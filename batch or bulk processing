.Batch processing : IT is a method of running high-volume,repetitive data jobs.Efficient way of moving large volumes of data across systems. 
                    .The batch method allows users to process data with little or no user interaction.
                    .To achieve best results,always match a batch trigger with batch actions.
.Batch triggers:.Total run time decreases significantly due to the reduction in wait time for API responses
                .Trigger events are retrived in lists instead of single events
                . The batch size depends on the application we are using like salesforce means 2000
.Batch actions: these are of the form- create ,update,upsert batch records
                .upsert-updates or freates multiple records in a single action
                       .requires a list of records with IDs to be updated as the input
                 .create- create multiple records in a single action ex:Move a list of records from source app to target app
                  .update- update multiple records in a single request
                            . requests a list of records with IDS to be updated as the input
.bulk processing:It ensures that we can do large quantities of processing while minimising the users wait time.
                 .Useful in bussiness processes that requires mass data transactions and syncing data information.
                  . Not all apps has bulk action ,bulk action is availability depends on the appa Api(salesforce,netsuite,googlesheets)
. create bulk-Create list of new records in a single action.
              . Field configuration allows data mappings for creation of records.
.upsert bulk-create list of new records in a single actions and update list of existing records.
            . A primary key such as External ID is required to determine whether a record exists.
