Recipe Life Cycle Management:
.Guide teams from automated discovery to production.
. Helps streamline end-to-end automation delivery process.
.Applies to abyproject regardless of methodology.
.Recipe lifecycle management helps organizations create a collaborative environment to share recipes between developers, testers, and operations teams.
Benefits:
.Improve Productivity through effective collaboration
.Enhances bussiness responsiveness to change 
.Increase bussinesss value through improved quality of service
planning for RLCM:
1.Identify environment strategy,roles and access policies-->2.Understand recipe lifecycle stages and governance process-->3.Define the recipes environment promotion process
Environment Management and tools:
Environment strategy:
.Planning and structuring different environments.
.Good environment helps multiple teams collaborate efficiently.
.recommend to have 3 sep environments- dev/Test/production-security and limited actions for bussiness systems.
                .Improve resilence by managing disruptions(dev/test)
                .Team efficiency improves for Better control with seamless handover between teams
Decentralized Governance:
   pros:1.Seperation of concerns, 2. Enhanced Control
   cons: 1. Duplication of effort  2. Enforcing best practices across teams
Centralised Governance: Is a approach i sto segment on eor more team accounts to allow access to different folders by different teams.
    pros:1.Consistent governance process 2. Prevents shadow IT
    cons:1.Role Management 2. Increased audit requirements
Teams:
.setup centralised access provisioning
.appropriate reviews and approvals of non-standard requests
.Use SSO(single-sign-on)/JIT or 2FA along with standardized identities- It eliminates the manual effort for managing user accounts and selecting permissions.
.Ensure team members have proper access to do their jobs successfully.
.Detect violations to prevent unauthorized activity.
.enforce policies consistently by Monitoring and auditing environment access
.easily filter to find roles,folder acess, and authentication methods for users.
.sort by latest activity and link to activity audit
.Review folder access for each user and role
.Check authentication method using security policies such as sso
.consider setting up automatic alertys foe policy violations.
Folder structure:
.Easier management and enhaced security
.Create seperate working spaces for a group of collaborators.
.Common way to organize recipies is to assign a folder to a bussiness unit or funtional areas.
.Avoid having many recipies in a single folder, including the default  home folder.
.Use nested folders in each functional area to further organize recipes and connections relevant to specific projects.
.Consider keeping the samefolder structure and names across dev,test, and production environments for uniformity.
.Scope shared connections and callable recipes by functional area.
.Optionally, restrict access to assets by team in shared workspace.
Recipe Naming Convention:
. FAcilitate communication btw members
.Include both an "automation Number" and recipe Identifier.
.Create a seperate spread sheet or other shared mechanism to keep inventory and mange unique identifiers.
.Avoid reusing decommisioned IDs
.Avoid naming assets based on enironments
.. Admin,Anaylst,Operator are three default system roles in every team account

.Dependency graph is the Workato capability can you use to assess the impact on shared assets such as callable recipes before implementing new changes
.How can you ensure policy compliance in your Workato environments?
 .Using Workato's activity audit logs to conduct regular audits
