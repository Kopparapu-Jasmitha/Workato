Conditional Actions:
      We can set a condition within the recipes to better define the workflow processing logic.
      Conditional actions will be carried out only if the specified condition is true
      Like if or else
      Two types of Conditional Actions:
       1. IF  2. IF-Else 3.ELSE
       IF: Data Field(on what like Amount), Condition(greater,equals), Value... Data and Values are Case Sensitive.
     Common Use cases: 1.Deduplication Logic-ensure that when you Sync over information to other application,there would not be the same record  
                       2.stopping the recipe- When an error occurs then we stop running the recipe
                       3.Invoking different function recipies
                       4.Setting up notifications for different error messages.
     Common Mistakes: 1.Mapping data pill from the wrong step output.
                      2.Mismatching the data types against operators.
  Null data conditions: "equals/ does not equal" and "is present/is not present"
2.Error Handling:
Error Monitoring and Handling:
          This can be used to 
              . Monitor Actions
              . retryfailed steps
              . execute other steps due to or in spite of the error
         Ex: send a custom error msg or error notification  when an error occurs.
         . stop Action- stops the job from executing further actions in the recipe
3a.Repeat Action
      Loop through a list of records
      . use a repeat action to iterate/loop through these
      . Used when working with a batch of records or list of items
      .upsert-insert and update the data from one aapplication to another application without creating duplicates.
     Common Use cases: CSVs/Database rows, Order line items(ETL),Any type of list/array
     Common Mistakes: .Mapping data pill from the wrong step output.
                      . Using a repeat actions when bulk actions/batch actions are avilable.
3b.Variables:
         Place holder to store data
         Create  variables to store information to be referenced and manipulated
         Once created, variables can also be updated within the same workflow.
         The lifetime of a variable is the duration of a single job.
      Common use cases: Transforming data 1.Formulas 2.list
      Common mistakes: unneccesary& excessive use, Recipe variables vs Account Properties, Failing to initialize your variables
                         .An unitialized variable has a value of null or nil
4.Look up Tables:
          Mini-database table
         Organized like a database table, with coloumns and rows of dta.
         Create a lookup table by importing from a csv or manually add coloumns or rows.
         supports up to 100,000 entries and 10 columns /entry. and retrive 10,000 entries
        CRUD- search,retrive,update,delete record
      . Tools navigation menu option can be used to manually create a lookup table.
        . Entries in lookup table can be retrived the actions like added,update,deleted via a recipe action
      Common use cases: static reference data,adding data of Temporary logs/error handling, compiling data for daily reports.
      Temporary Login: use lookup tables as a temporary data store for small data sets. Ex: error messages,state of a process
      Common mistakes: Storing large amounts of data , storing lookup data that already exists in source systems.
...The total number of number of rows you can retrive from a lookup table- 10,000
Lists:
.two types of lists 1.Basic lists-Rows are self-contained where all information required is explicitly expressed in each field.
2. Nested lists- Details of the rows in a parent list are contained in a seperate child list.
.When using actions that accept lists as an input, there are two input modes that can be chosen: dynamic list or fixed list.
